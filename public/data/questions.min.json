If you want to plant a tree within 12 feet of the curb, you'll need a permit and a License Agreement from the City of Tulsa.

The best spot for a rain garden is the lowest point in your yard, where rainwater flows naturally. To determine the size of your garden, multiply the square footage of hard surfaces (roof, patio, sidewalk) on your property by 5-10%. Keep in mind that not all of those hard surfaces may direct rain water to your garden. Once your garden is situated, dig out a six to eight inch deep depression for maximum absorption. The key factor for a rain garden is the rate at which water infiltrates the soil. If you find that the soil is hard-packed or doesn't drain well, it's worth picking a different spot or digging deeper to amend the soil with sand. When its time to plant, choose native varieties to attract pollinators, specifically ones that can tolerate wet roots for a day or two.

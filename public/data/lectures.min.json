[{"id":"recW7FzEDgnLxgOXA","Scope":"Generic","Title":"The Marketplace for Public Services","Description":"Bureaucracies are conceptualized in the American mind as unelected implementers of public policy, but their role in the policy process is more nuanced. Specifically, emergent bureaucracies quickly develop their own interests, which leads to bureaucratic drift. This drift can be exploited by bureaucracies via information asymmetries. During the policy\nimplementation stage, bureaucracies utilize the implementation process to realize their interests. Like private organizations, bureaucracies must compete with each other in a market for public services in which they sell their services to legislatures. This facilitates a profit motivated relationship with legislatures, who must oversee a vast range of departments.","Concepts":["recyUhPcjsDzsScmC","recZGYXKlh8RlEwdK","rec5JRkUz4lxo7w3b","recP96BwfKjZS41Yz","recnJZQVtMQNcYPXR","rec2Q91Wp6xImXY3l","recct9JpOTgiUjHA8","recUsrtw12nhWycjO"],"Questions":["recO99bFUuIOWT8Fc","rec22vUo6XQn4LKgZ","recTA2vkHRLMGxYwu","recHlZ6Oa7SiH4Jjb"]},{"id":"recsc9bAdCJMpxmUR","Scope":"Generic","Title":"Central Planning & Program Implementation","Description":"At origin, most public programs are designed to give discretion to the bureaucracies implementing such programs. With such discretion comes a ‘decision making of decision making’ whereby bureaucracies must decide which decisions are to be centralized at the top of organizational hierarchies and which are to be delegated downward to various subunits. This lecture uses such meta decision making to explain the failure of federal agencies to adequately address the impacts of Hurricane Katrina. The second half of this\nlecture tells the story of how various bureaus within departments interact to implement policy and how the ways that street-level bureaucrats interact with the public influence the final stages of policy implementation.","Concepts":["recqcq7C8OY8YIHlo","rec0ObzmjvisioWMC","recLNlJ0yTV2qyeVt","recYuKZo8o1UWVCXf","recqCNT3QUhp7H8Ct","rec192rQcizZ3KdNT","recYNX74h8LF2lydB","recF1ZUrkd9t7KWiX","recopFgxj39QjOyzJ","reckQEQ5QydTfCQHK","recInzFche3bvfF05","recxLC5xsub1iTLiG","recxA5qxTW4SDADcE"],"Questions":["recBc4JbfKfMbB9ZB","recvRKFbXh6BClSjk","recAXnQCK3wnkXtcl","recDVlk34gsyN3MQt"]},{"id":"recjgeKZP1QkDmN80","Scope":"Generic","Title":"Performance Management & Its Failures","Description":"Contemporary media turns the focus on public programs to their performance. However, this understanding of performance is ultimately dependent on optimized performance management systems, which are difficult to develop - let alone sustain. Even bureaus within the same department may have different understanding of the goals of the program, how to collect and retain data on program performance as well as which\naspects of the program to evaluate. Further, performance management systems are dependent on an accurate articulation of the causes of the problems they work to address. Finally, for performance management systems to be useful they must exist in institutional locations in which they can be employed to inform changes to service delivery.","Concepts":["recnJZQVtMQNcYPXR","rec5hQQHn3AkmIJcV","recct9JpOTgiUjHA8","recM262ngbuTEBcut","recsc3j9AFxiWBXWU","recN4o7zWg78yhnMP","recPhb052MmW0BPg9","recWGFQGGlhi3hBRd","recj4QjONVQraxy5N","recqwajnQ1AnXdG8v","recW8S5oMic7f66Ps","recDKPo9h6gXbUesz","recrAbKFKmTloljxh","rechjPCJncdo1AAbY"],"Questions":["reckQhKzBXirsI4RG","recEuQuTe6TJq09BR","reckLQqIcQLVqb7jm","recVyIvro0GaqHhbK"]},{"id":"recsmwioc0RfJII4Q","Scope":"Generic","Title":"The Rise of Cross-Sector Contracting & The Accountability Question","Description":"What story does this lecture tell? Even for capital intensive services, delivering many services in-house was historically the default for bureaucracies. However, contracting with both private and nonprofit organizations has become ubiquitous since the 1980s in most areas of service delivery. With the rise of contracting comes questions pertaining to how private and nonprofit actors are to be held accountable while still being faced with the abiding challenges of how to evaluate the process and performance of service delivery. In an environment in which governments lack adequate data sharing institutions, each government develops its own norms for performance management in cross sector contracting, which informs quality of public services.","Concepts":["rectogalt6pP7SQG5","recg6Ow9P4c5VSX3W","recYiiP3RcVALFX2h","reckvtWne0dxhk8yu","recwb2w2AnEnkF7Kv","recZWdt8XcY0AWd7f","recy4VMDrxLQodPuv","rechjPCJncdo1AAbY"],"Questions":["recpNe4rncmsA6utF","rec1RCj9CqQbzvcns","rec00q2ptQQ8DdQJP"]},{"id":"recQYGFd7fNX3QDfX","Scope":"Generic","Title":"Collaborative Governance & Networks","Description":"Within bureaucracies, bureaucrats form relationships with one another, forming networks. The place that bureaucrats find themselves within their network has vast implications for public performance. However, these networks manifest inter-organizationally as well. As governments collaborate with each other, private organizations, and nonprofit organizations, they too form relationships in environments that come to constitute networks. Public managers and elected officials increasingly find themselves having to manage and exploit the relationships they form in these networks to achieve results. As these networks become more transitive and robust, collaborative governance regimes manifest in which intergovernmental collaboration with sustained engagement within specified cliques becomes the default foundation for service delivery. Further, these regimes often reinforce existing power structures and concretize privileged access to resources.","Concepts":["rec8MjOu0QeK9E08K","recL4OHo2lhdBcRFF","recbsSiNhA5ctGGfg","recCs4YM60GaXAgUY","recppoan5D7lcWjKy","recBVXOmC1GnPj6go","recynb6mEPFdI70Bq","recxe5ymD72XAJnGa","recG6dIURKaUyzVKQ"],"Questions":["rec1xnEICrb6GJwh3","recWMKDUihK6DwbpN","rec5VTc8rCF2kx4WE"]},{"id":"recoMyza69V02sfCv","Scope":"Generic","Title":"Local Institutions for Problem Solving in American Federalism","Description":"The service areas that municipalities are tasked with optimizing, such as economic development, transportation, crime, and housing, transcend the jurisdictions over which such municipalities have authorities. In order to cope with the spatial mismatch, actors operating within municipalities, state governments, and federal agencies develop a variety of jurisdiction spanning institutions through which services can be delivered. The eternal question of how regions are to be governed is answered through the\nemployment of these institutions. However, the research on how these institutions influence each other is just now being conducted. This research points to the capacity of regional organizations to inform the employment of alternative means of inter-organizational collaboration within regions.","Concepts":["recqCNT3QUhp7H8Ct","reclH5JnIQpN909tl","recujibGuh3oHZMdX","recGrJoyUY62iGhnq","receqNASjEeV48gtY","reczlt8OPAPgv3ZYs","recH1VpqS6HtCenxK","recp8HSzpkaqBykir","rec4hf7kl2KbCAAhf","recyxconZIHjf0aNu","recJO0LiTqJMFmeFZ","rec8029tY6QGmOft8","recpuF5zQ4f15bTtj","receA02yhiWmYtJ7S"],"Questions":["recyxKbvQQLnkyQOl","reccUnJZ2VCoDp4iq","recjwbdXp4xarMXa0","recxBoXz07hVqtYDZ"]},{"id":"rec4zu3A34ouYqihS","Scope":"Generic","Title":"Developing Regions & Economic Conflict","Description":"Cities, the regions they inhabit, and the states inhabited by these regions are faced with an impetus towards development.
